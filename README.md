## About Me

I'm a game developer in the making and AI enthusiast with a strong curiosity for how things work under the hood.  
I enjoy building immersive 3D experiences, games, and occasionally diving into some reverse-engineering.

I like working both solo and in teams, and I bring strong initiative and leadership when it's needed.  
Currently studying software engineering at **INSAT** while working part-time and freelancing.
